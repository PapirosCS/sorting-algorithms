<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
<h3>Practical Examples</h3>
<hr/>

This application executes both bubble sort and insertion sort on a std::array<int, 20000>
and displays the execution time of both.

The array size can be changed easily.

Soon I'll add merge sort and quicksort.

Big thanks to stackoverflow user:

from where I took the method to measure execution times.
